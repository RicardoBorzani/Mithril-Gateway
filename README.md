# Mithril Gateway

The Mithril Gateway project is a Spring Cloud Gateway-based API gateway designed to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate backend service. It provides load balancing.

## Sprint backlog

### Sprint 1: Gateway Setup and Basic Routing.

#### Description: The goal of this sprint is to set up the project structure and implement basic routing configuration for the Spring Cloud Gateway. You will also add the necessary dependencies and write unit tests for routing to ensure that your code is working as intended.
#### Objective: By the end of this sprint, you should have a working Spring Cloud Gateway application with basic routing functionality that is thoroughly tested.

- Set up project structure
- Add Spring Cloud Gateway dependency
- Implement basic routing configuration
- Write unit tests for routing

### Sprint 2: HTTPS, CORS, and Load Balancing Configuration.

#### Description: In this sprint, you will add support for HTTPS requests, configure CORS headers for API requests, and implement load balancing configuration. You will also write unit tests for load balancing to ensure that your code is working as expected.
#### Objective: By the end of this sprint, you should have a more secure and reliable Spring Cloud Gateway application with load balancing capabilities that is thoroughly tested.

- Add support for HTTPS requests
- Configure CORS headers for API requests
- Implement load balancing configuration
- Write unit tests for load balancing

### Sprint 3: Authentication and User Management Integration.

#### Description: The focus of this sprint is to add authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and JWT tokens, write unit tests for authentication and authorization, and integrate with an external user management system.
#### Objective: By the end of this sprint, you should have a more secure and user-friendly Spring Cloud Gateway application with authentication and authorization features that is thoroughly tested.

- Add authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and JWT tokens
- Write unit tests for authentication and authorization
- Integrate with an external user management system

### Sprint 4: Rate Limiting, Throttling, and Docker Setup.

#### Description: In this sprint, you will implement rate limiting and throttling for API requests, write unit tests for rate limiting and throttling, and set up a Docker Compose instance for local development.
#### Objective: By the end of this sprint, you should have a more efficient and scalable Spring Cloud Gateway application with rate limiting and throttling capabilities that can be easily developed and tested locally.

- Implement rate limiting and throttling for API requests
- Write unit tests for rate limiting and throttling
- Set up Docker Compose instance for local development

### Sprint 5: Logging, Monitoring, Caching, and Deployment.

#### Description: The final sprint will focus on configuring logging and monitoring for the production environment, implementing caching for frequently accessed resources, and writing unit tests for caching. You will also deploy the application to the production environment.
#### Objective: By the end of this sprint, you should have a fully functional and scalable Spring Cloud Gateway application that is thoroughly tested, monitored, and optimized for production use.

- Configure logging and monitoring for production environment
- Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
- Write unit tests for caching
- Deploy to production environment
