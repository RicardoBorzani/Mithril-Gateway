To complete Sprint 2B and configure CORS headers for API requests in the Mithril Gateway project, you will need to:

Define a list of allowed origins for CORS requests.
Configure the Spring Cloud Gateway to use a CorsWebFilter to handle CORS requests.
Add the appropriate CorsConfiguration to the CorsWebFilter.
Apply the CorsWebFilter to the routes that require CORS handling.
You may also need to configure additional properties in the CorsConfiguration depending on your project's specific needs, such as allowed headers or methods. Once the configuration is in place, you can test the functionality using a client that sends CORS requests to the Mithril Gateway API.
