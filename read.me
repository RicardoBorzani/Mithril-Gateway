To complete the task "Add support for HTTPS requests" in Sprint 2 of the Mithril Gateway project, you can follow these steps:

Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. You can obtain a free certificate from Let's Encrypt or purchase one from a certificate authority.
Configure your Spring Cloud Gateway instance to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. You can do this by configuring the appropriate properties in your application.yaml file, including the port and SSL/TLS configuration.
Configure your load balancer or reverse proxy (if applicable) to forward HTTPS traffic to your Spring Cloud Gateway instance.
Test your HTTPS configuration to ensure it is working properly.
It's important to note that you should also update any clients or applications that use your API to use HTTPS instead of HTTP to maintain secure communication.
