To complete the task "Set up Docker Compose instance for local development" in Sprint 4 of the Mithril Gateway project backlog, you can follow these steps:

Install Docker on your local machine if you haven't already.
Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory of your project. This file will define the containers, volumes, and networks required for your application.
Define the services you need in the docker-compose.yml file. For example, you might need a service for your application, a database, and a Redis cache.
Configure any necessary environment variables for your services in the docker-compose.yml file.
Define any volumes or networks required for your application in the docker-compose.yml file.
Build and start the containers using the docker-compose up command.
Verify that your application is running in the container and accessible from your local machine.
Once you have completed these steps, you will have a Docker Compose instance set up for local development of your Mithril Gateway project.
