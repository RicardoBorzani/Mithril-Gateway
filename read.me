To complete Sprint 5 A, "Configure logging and monitoring for production environment," you should:

Choose a logging framework such as Logback or Log4j2 and integrate it with your application.
Configure log levels for different components of your application, so you can easily filter and search through logs.
Choose a monitoring tool such as Prometheus or Grafana and integrate it with your application.
Set up monitoring for key metrics such as response time, error rate, and request volume.
Configure alerts for when these metrics exceed predefined thresholds.
These tasks will ensure that your application is properly instrumented for monitoring and that you have the tools in place to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues in production.
