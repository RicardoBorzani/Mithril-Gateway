To write unit tests for authentication and authorization in Sprint 3 of the Mithril Gateway project, you would need to do the following steps:

Identify the different scenarios for authentication and authorization in your system, such as valid and invalid user credentials, expired tokens, etc.

Write test cases for each scenario, making sure to cover all possible edge cases.

Use a testing framework such as JUnit to write unit tests for your code.

Create mock objects or stubs for any external dependencies that your code relies on, such as user management systems or OAuth2 providers.

Use the Spring Security Test framework to write tests that simulate the behavior of your authentication and authorization logic.

Verify that your tests pass and provide sufficient code coverage.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your authentication and authorization logic is thoroughly tested and reliable.
