To complete Sprint 2 D, "Write unit tests for load balancing" in the Mithril Gateway project, you can follow these steps:

Identify the classes and methods responsible for load balancing in the project. This might include the configuration classes for load balancing, the load balancing algorithm implementation, and the load balancing filter.

Write unit tests for each of these classes and methods. The tests should cover different scenarios and edge cases, such as testing how the load balancer behaves when one of the target servers is unavailable or when there are multiple requests at the same time.

Use a testing framework like JUnit to write the unit tests. JUnit provides a variety of assertion methods and test fixtures that can simplify the process of writing unit tests.

Make sure to run the unit tests frequently during the development process to catch any regressions or errors early on.

Once the unit tests are passing, integrate the load balancing functionality into the project and verify that it is working as expected.
