To complete the task of integrating with an external user management system during Sprint 3 of the Mithril Gateway project, you would need to:

Identify the external user management system that will be used and review its documentation to understand its APIs and integration options.
Implement the necessary configuration and code changes to enable integration with the chosen user management system.
Write unit tests to ensure the integration is working correctly and all user-related functions are being properly handled.
Collaborate with the team responsible for the external user management system to ensure proper integration and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
Overall, the goal of this task is to allow the Mithril Gateway project to authenticate and authorize users using an external system, rather than managing users internally. This can help to reduce development time and ensure secure and scalable user management.
