In Sprint 1 C: Implement basic routing configuration, you need to configure the routing rules for your Spring Cloud Gateway. This involves defining the routes that the gateway should handle, and configuring how those routes are mapped to backend services.

Here are the steps you can follow to complete this task:

Define the routes you want to handle in your application. This could include paths like "/api/users" or "/api/products".

Configure the Spring Cloud Gateway to handle those routes. This involves defining a route predicate, which matches incoming requests to the appropriate route, and a route filter, which applies any necessary transformations or validations to the request before it is sent to the backend service.

Test your routing configuration by sending requests to your application and verifying that they are routed correctly.

Write unit tests for your routing configuration to ensure that it continues to work correctly as your application evolves.
