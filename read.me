To complete Sprint 5 D: Deploy to production environment, you would need to prepare the application for deployment to a production environment, and then actually deploy it. This could involve tasks such as:

Configuring the application with production-specific settings, such as a production database, production API keys, and appropriate security settings.
Building and packaging the application into a deployable format, such as a Docker image or a WAR file.
Creating infrastructure to host the application, such as virtual machines, cloud instances, or Kubernetes clusters.
Setting up the necessary networking and security infrastructure, such as load balancers, firewalls, and SSL certificates.
Deploying the application to the production environment using an appropriate deployment tool, such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Kubernetes.
It's important to ensure that the deployment process is automated and repeatable, so that you can easily deploy new versions of the application as needed. Additionally, you should have a plan in place for monitoring the application once it's deployed, and for handling any issues that arise.
