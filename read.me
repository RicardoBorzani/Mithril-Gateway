To implement rate limiting and throttling for API requests in Sprint 4 of the Mithril Gateway project, you can follow these steps:

Choose a rate limiting and throttling strategy that suits the project's requirements. There are various strategies available, such as token bucket, leaky bucket, and fixed window.

Integrate the chosen strategy with the Spring Cloud Gateway framework. Spring Cloud Gateway provides built-in support for several rate limiting and throttling strategies.

Configure the rate limiting and throttling rules for each route in the gateway. This can be done by adding filters to the gateway's configuration.

Write unit tests for the rate limiting and throttling functionality to ensure that it works as expected and that the chosen strategy is correctly implemented.

Run integration tests to verify that the rate limiting and throttling rules are applied correctly in a real-world scenario.

Document the rate limiting and throttling functionality, including the chosen strategy, configuration options, and any limitations or known issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully implement rate limiting and throttling for API requests in the Mithril Gateway project.
