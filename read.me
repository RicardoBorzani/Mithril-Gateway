To complete the task "Write unit tests for caching" in Sprint 5 of the Mithril Gateway project backlog, you should follow these steps:

Identify the parts of the codebase that implement caching for frequently accessed resources.
Write unit tests for each caching implementation, ensuring that they cover different scenarios and edge cases.
Use a testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG to write and execute the unit tests.
Make sure that the unit tests pass and provide adequate coverage of the caching implementation.
Integrate the unit tests into your build process so that they are automatically run whenever code changes are made.
By following these steps, you will ensure that the caching implementation is thoroughly tested and reliable.
