To add authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and JWT tokens in the Mithril Gateway project, you should follow these steps:

Add the necessary dependencies to your project's build file, such as Spring Security, OAuth2 libraries, and JWT libraries.
Configure your application to use Spring Security and OAuth2. This includes setting up the security configuration for your application and creating a client registration for your application with the OAuth2 server.
Implement the OAuth2 authentication flow in your application, including redirecting the user to the OAuth2 server to obtain an access token and using that token to authenticate API requests.
Generate and validate JWT tokens to ensure that API requests are properly authorized.
Create and configure roles and permissions for users and API resources in your application.
Write unit tests for your authentication and authorization implementation.
Keep in mind that integrating with an external user management system, as mentioned in Sprint 3 C, may require additional configuration and implementation work.
